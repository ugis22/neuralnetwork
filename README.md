# Understanding Neural Networks

Neural networks is one of the most powerful and widely used algorithms when it comes to deep learning. At first look, neural networks may seem a black box; an input layer gets the data into the *"hidden layers"* and after a magic trick we can see the information provided by the output layer. However, understanding what the hidden layers are doing is the key step to neural network implementation and optimization.

As a consequence, the goal of this project is to understand and build a neural network
